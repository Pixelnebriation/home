                <p>Pixelnebriation is a meet-up event for people starting out, or wanting to get into the gaming industry, as well as people who are already 
                    well established. People who are also just interested in gaming are also welcome! It provides a 'safe space' for people who may not be 
                    comfortable with socialising or networking, to talk with
                    others similar folks. Leading to possible collaberations, or new friendships. It also provides the chance to talk to experienced
                    people in the industry. <br>
                    <br>
                    The locations of each Pixelnebriation event vary around London, but are always in casual and fun places such as Loading Bar in Dalston.
                    The next event will be located at The Association for UK Interactive Entertainment (UKIE) building in Hatton Wall.
